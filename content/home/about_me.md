I am a Berkeley Math and Computer Science double major with an interest in doing research
 in cryptography and theoretical computer science. I have 4+ years of programming experience 
and teaching myself advanced math topics. Using a mix of theoretical and practical skills,
 I am keen to explore the underlying principles behind computer science.
