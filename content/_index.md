Hello! I'm Ian Loam, a Math and CS major at UC Berkeley. I am passionate about cryptography, theoretical computer science and pure math.

In my free time: I read critical theory and philosophy; I go out running; study for the putnam; and listen to a lot of [music](https://open.spotify.com/user/5q2l5w4vdwraoftg5qah3rvse).
