Hello! I'm Ian Loam, a Math and CS major at UC Berkeley. I am passionate about cryptography, theoretical computer science and pure math. 

In my free time: I read critical theory and philosophy; practice for triathlons; study for the putnam; and listen to a lot of music...

I am currently looking for research positions studying: complexity theory, post-quantum cryptography, algebraic geometry, or deep learning theory; and summer internships related to: defense tech or cybersecurity

If you are curious about my past experience and skills look at my [resume](/resume.pdf) and [library](/library). Feel free to reach out!
